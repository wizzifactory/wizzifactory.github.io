		p Local plugins can be located anywhere on the user drive and the plugin folder path is declared to the Wizzi factory
			\b instead of the plugin name.

        p The 
            high-code( package.json )
            span file is not required. The plugin interface must be exposed in the
            high-code( index.js )
            span file located in the plugin folder.
