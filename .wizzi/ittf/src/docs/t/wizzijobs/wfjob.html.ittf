			\b can result in many production because the 'src' attribute of this element
			\b may refer to:
			ul
				li one single source model
				li a group of source models described by a glob pattern
				li one single source model which Model element declares a model collection
					\b property, meaning that each item of the collection is a source model
					\b of the production and produces one artifact.
