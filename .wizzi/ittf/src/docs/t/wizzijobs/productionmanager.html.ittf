        p The production of complex software systems can
            \b require a great number of model processing, transformations
            \b and artifact generations.

        p The wizzi.production.productionManager class implements an
            \b api for scheduling complex jobs. It is the wizzi factory
            \b task manager.

        p A Wizzi Model type implemented by the 'wizzi-core' plugin , the 'wfjob' schema,
            \b can be used to describe wizzi factory jobs. A 'wfjob' model organizes models processing
            \b and artifact generations in production lines that are executed in 
            \b sequence, so that a line can prepare models and artifacts for the next one.

        p A job is executed calling the following method of the 
            \b wizzi.WizziFactory instance class.

        ittf-panel
            schema js
            ittf
                ...
                    m executeJob
                        { jobRequest
                            string name
                                # for info and error messages
                            string path
                                # path to the 'wfjob' ittf document that the wizzi.production.productionManager will load.
